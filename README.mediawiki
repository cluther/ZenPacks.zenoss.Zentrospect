This ZenPack provides support for monitoring Zenoss servers. Specifically at
this point this means monitoring Zenoss servers that have the
[https://github.com/cluther/zenoss-snmp-module zenoss-snmp-module] extension
to Net-SNMP installed to expose internal process metrics via SNMP.

== Features ==

The features added by this ZenPack can be summarized as follows. They are
detailed further below.

* Discovery of Zenoss systems, processes and metrics thereof.
* Monitoring of process metric values.
* Monitoring of process metric freshness.

=== Discovery ===

The following entities will be automatically discovered from server devices
that are running Zenoss, have the ''zenoss.snmp.ZenossSNMP'' modeler plugin
assigned, and have the ''zenoss-snmp-module'' extension to Net-SNMP installed
and configured properly.

;Zenoss Systems
: Attributes: Name
: Collections: Zenoss Processes, Zenoss Metrics

;Zenoss Processes
: Attributes: Name, System
: Collections: Zenoss Metrics

;Zenoss Metrics
: Attributes: Name, System, Process

=== Monitoring ===

The following metrics will be collected every 5 minutes by default.

;Metrics
: Metrics: zenProcessMetricValue, zenProcessMetricCyclesSinceUpdate

''zenProcessMetricValue'' is the most recent value recorded for the metric. It
will be NaN in cases where a value hasn't been recorded recently.

''zenProcessMetricCyclesSinceUpdate'' is how many "cycle intervals" it has been
since the value was successfully recorded. This measure is used because some
metrics are updated on different cycle intervals. For example, if the
localhost-zenperfsnmp-devices metric is updated every 300 seconds and was last
updated 30 seconds ago, the zenProcessMetricCyclesSinceUpdate value will be
0.1.

By default a maximum threshold of 2 is set for
zenProcessMetricCyclesSinceUpdate on all discovered metrics. This can be used
to identify Zenoss processes that are not functioning properly.

=== Service Impact ===

When combined with the Zenoss Service Dynamics product, this ZenPack adds
service impact capability for the entities it discovers. The following service
impact relationships are automatically added. These will be included in any
services that contain one or more of the explicitly mentioned entities.

;Service Impact Relationships
: A ''Device'' failure impacts all associated ''Zenoss Systems''.
: A ''Zenoss System'' failure impacts all associated ''Zenoss Processes''.
: A ''Zenoss Process'' failure impacts all associated ''Zenoss Metrics''.

== Usage ==

To make use of this ZenPack you must first install
[https://github.com/cluther/zenoss-snmp-module zenoss-snmp-module] on your
Zenoss server(s). It provides valuable information on any server running Zenoss
processes. This includes masters, hubs and collectors.

You must then assign the ''zenoss.snmp.ZenossSNMP'' modeler plugin that comes
with this ZenPack to any devices that have ''zenoss-snmp-module'' installed.
The devices must then be remodeled.

== Installed Items ==

Installing this ZenPack will add the following items to your Zenoss system.

;Modeler Plugins
: zenoss.snmp.ZenossSNMP

;Monitor Templates
: ZentrospectMetric (in /)

;Component Types
: Zenoss System (on any device)
: Zenoss Process (on Zenoss System components)
: Zenoss Metric (on Zenoss Process components)
